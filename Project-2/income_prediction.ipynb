You can use any Python built-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages (the packages listed above are all fine to use); if your iPython notebook doesn't run on the marker's machine, you will lose marks. <b> You should use Python 3</b>.  \n",

    "\n",
    "**(a)** The three Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers lead to different performance. Which of the three NB classifiers performs best, and why do you think it is the case? **[1 mark]**\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b)** There is a systematic difference between Accuracy and F1 score, across all models. Describe and explain the difference in the context of the data set. **[1 mark]**\n",
    "\n",
    "**(c)** Assume that your best classifier will be deployed in a bank to decide whether a customer will be granted a loan, or not. A loan will be granted if the classifier predicts an income of \">50K\", othewise it won't. The bank manager wants to avoid falsely granting a loan to an applicant with insufficient income by all means. Can you reassure the bank manager with the evaluation results in Q7 that your classifier is adequate? If not, describe an alternative evaluation metric and explain why it is more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(d)** Do you observe a clear difference in performance between NB and Logistic Regression (LR) in Q7? Referring to the number of parameters and assumptions underlying each model, provide one reason why NB might outperform LR, and one reason why LR might outperform NB. In your answer, refer back to the *Adult* data set used in this assignment. **[1 mark]**\n",
    "\n",
    "**(e)** Assume that you have access to a (hypothetical) infinitely large U.S. census database (i.e., an enormous version of the *Adult* data set used in this assignment). Is it true that Logistic Regression, but not Naive Bayes, will achieve perfect test set performance? Why (not)? **[1 mark]**\n",

    "(a). NB Num and NB Full perform best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because both NB Num and NB Full used GaussianNB. Furthermore, the 1hot features are all in binary, therefore, these features would not influence the result of GaussianNB as num features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(b). If the classifier accuracy is higher than the other classifier, the fi score for that classifier is lower than the other classifier, vice-versa. To be specific, the accuracy of NB Num is higher than NB Cat, but Macro F1 of NB Num is lower than NB Cat.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) No, the metric should include all the features above and also criminal record. Because some people might stop paying the loan, after they go to jail again. Nevertheless, the person who have not been to jail before, they have less possibility to be in jail.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Yes. When the dimensions of instance is very wide, the Logistic Regression might be very unprecise because the true condition would be very strict.(NB might outperform LR) On contrast, Naive Bayes assumed that all the features are independent, but some feature may related to other features. In data sets, for instance, education and education-num might have some relation might influence the accuracy of NB.(LR might outperform NB)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(e)From my perspective, Logistic Regression would outperform than NB because the dimention is not very wide and some features are related. Furthermore, Naive Bayes is good at small aount of data, but when apply Logistic Regression in huge data set, the classifier would be very accurate. Therefore, Logistic Regression would be better."
